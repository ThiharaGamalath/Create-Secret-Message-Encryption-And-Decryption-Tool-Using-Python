# Secret Message Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting secret messages. It uses a simple encryption algorithm to encode the message, making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key.

## Features

- Encrypt messages using a secret key
- Decrypt encrypted messages with the correct key
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (should be included in most Python distributions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install Tkinter if it's not already installed. (Usually included with Python)
4. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Enter your secret message in the input field.
3. Choose a secret key to encrypt the message.
4. Click on the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message.
5. To decrypt a previously encrypted message, enter the encrypted message and the correct key.
6. Click on the "Decrypt" button to reveal the original message.
